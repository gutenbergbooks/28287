<h3>I</h3>

<p>Walter Scott was born in Edinburgh, August 15, 1771, of an ancient
Scotch clan numbering in its time many a hard rider and good fighter,
and more than one of these petty chieftains, half-shepherd and
half-robber, who made good the winter inroads into their stock of beeves
by spring forays and cattle drives across the English Border. Scott's
great-grandfather was the famous "Beardie" of Harden, so called because
after the exile of the Stuart sovereigns he swore never to cut his beard
until they were reinstated; and several degrees farther back he could
point to a still more famous figure, "Auld Wat of Harden," who with his
fair dame, the "Flower of Yarrow," is mentioned in <span class="italic">The Lay of the Last
Minstrel</span>. The first member of the clan to abandon country life and take
up a sedentary profession, was Scott's father, who settled in Edinburgh
as Writer to the Signet, a position corresponding in Scotland to that of
attorney or solicitor in England. The character of this father, stern,
scrupulous, Calvinistic, with a high sense of ceremonial dignity and a
punctilious regard for the honorable conventions of life, united with
the wilder ancestral strain to make Scott what he was. From "Auld Wat"
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> "Beardie" came his high spirit, his rugged manliness, his chivalric
ideals; from the Writer to the Signet came that power of methodical
labor which made him a giant among the literary workers of his day, and
that delicate sense of responsibility which gave his private life its
remarkable sweetness and beauty.</p>

<p>At the age of eighteen months, Scott was seized with a teething fever
which settled in his right leg and retarded its growth to such an extent
that he was slightly lame for the rest of his life. Possibly this
affliction was a blessing in disguise, since it is not improbable that
Scott's love of active adventure would have led him into the army or the
navy, if he had not been deterred by a bodily impediment; in which case
English history might have been a gainer, but English literature would
certainly have been immeasurably a loser. In spite of his lameness, the
child grew strong enough to be sent on a long visit to his grandfather's
farm at Sandyknowe; and here, lying among the sheep on the windy downs,
playing about the romantic ruins of Smailholm Tower,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> scampering
through the heather on a tiny Shetland pony, or listening to stories of
the thrilling past told by the old women of the farm, he drank in
sensations which strengthened both the hardiness and the romanticism of
his nature. A story is told of his being found in the fields during a
thunder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> storm, clapping his hands at each flash of lightning, and
shouting "Bonny! Bonny!"&mdash;a bit of infantile intrepidity which makes
more acceptable a story of another sort illustrative of his mental
precocity. A lady entering his mother's room found him reading aloud a
description of a shipwreck, accompanying the words with excited comments
and gestures. "There's the mast gone," he cried, "crash it goes; they
will all perish!" The lady entered into his agitation with tact, and on
her departure, he told his mother that he liked their visitor, because
"she was a virtuoso, like himself." To her amused inquiry as to what a
virtuoso might be, he replied: "Don't ye know? why, 'tis one who wishes
to and will know everything."</p>

<p>As a boy at school in Edinburgh and in Kelso, and afterwards as a
student at the University and apprentice in his father's law office,
Scott took his own way to become a "virtuoso"; a rather queer way it
must sometimes have seemed to his good preceptors. He refused
point-blank to learn Greek, and cared little for Latin. His scholarship
was so erratic that he glanced meteor-like from the head to the foot of
his classes and back again, according as luck gave or withheld the
question to which his highly selective memory had retained the answer.
But outside of school hours he was intensely at work to "know
everything," so far as "everything" came within the bounds of his
special tastes. Before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> he was ten years old he had begun to collect
chap-books and ballads. As he grew older he read omnivorously in romance
and history; at school he learned French for the sole purpose of knowing
at first hand the fascinating cycles of old French romance; a little
later he mastered Italian in order to read Dante and Ariosto, and to his
schoolmaster's indignation stoutly championed the claim of the latter
poet to superiority over Homer; a little later he acquired Spanish and
read <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span> in the original. With such efforts, however,
considerable as they were for a boy who passionately loved a "bicker" in
the streets and who was famed among his comrades for bravery in climbing
the perilous "kittle nine stanes" on Castle Rock, he was not content.
Nothing more conclusively shows the genuineness of Scott's romantic
feeling than his willingness to undergo severe mental drudgery in
pursuit of knowledge concerning the old storied days which had
enthralled his imagination. It was no moonshine sentimentality which
kept him hour after hour and day after day in the Advocate's Library,
poring over musty manuscripts, deciphering heraldic devices, tracing
genealogies, and unraveling obscure points of Scottish history. By the
time he was twenty-one he had made himself, almost unconsciously, an
expert paleographer and antiquarian, whose assistance was sought by
professional workers in those branches of knowledge. Carlyle has charged
against Scott that he poured out his vast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> floods of poetry and romance
without preparation or forethought; that his production was always
impromptu, and rooted in no sufficient past of acquisition. The charge
cannot stand. From his earliest boyhood until his thirtieth year, when
he began his brilliant career as poet and novelist, his life was one
long preparation&mdash;very individual and erratic preparation, perhaps, but
none the less earnest and fruitful.</p>

<p>In 1792, Scott, then twenty-one years old, was admitted a member of the
faculty of advocates of Edinburgh. During the five years which elapsed
between this date and his marriage, his life was full to overflowing of
fun and adventure, rich with genial companionship, and with experience
of human nature in all its wild and tame varieties. Ostensibly he was a
student of law, and he did, indeed, devote some serious attention to the
mastery of his profession. But the dry formalities of legal life his
keen humor would not allow him to take quite seriously. On the day when
he was called to the bar, while waiting his turn among the other young
advocates, he turned to his friend, William Clark, who had been called
with him, and whispered, mimicking the Highland lasses who used to stand
at the Cross of Edinburgh to be hired for the harvest: "We've stood here
an hour by the Tron, hinny, and deil a ane has speered<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> our price."
Though Scott never made a legal reputation, either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> as pleader at the
bar or as an authority upon legal history and principles, it cannot be
doubted that his experience in the Edinburgh courts was of immense
benefit to him. In the first place, his study of the Scotch statutes,
statutes which had taken form very gradually under the pressure of
changing national conditions, gave him an insight into the politics and
society of the past not otherwise to have been obtained. Of still more
value, perhaps, was the association with his young companions in the
profession, and daily contact with the racy personalities which
traditionally haunt all courts of law, and particularly Scotch courts of
law: the first association kept him from the affectation and
sentimentality which is the bane of the youthful romanticist; and the
second enriched his memory with many an odd figure afterward to take its
place, clothed in the colors of a great dramatic imagination, upon the
stage of his stories.</p>

<p>Added to these experiences, there were others equally calculated to
enlarge his conception of human nature. Not the least among these he
found in the brilliant literary and artistic society of Edinburgh, to
which his mother's social position gave him entrance. Here, when only a
lad, he met Robert Burns, then the pet and idol of the fashionable
coteries of the capital. Here he heard Henry Mackenzie deliver a lecture
on German literature which turned his attention to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> romantic poetry
of Germany and led directly to his first attempts at ballad-writing. But
much more vital than any or all of these influences, were those endless
walking-tours which alone or in company with a boon companion he took
over the neighboring country-side&mdash;care-free, roystering expeditions,
which he afterwards immortalized as Dandie Dinmont's "Liddesdale raids"
in <span class="italic">Guy Mannering</span>. Thirty miles across country as the crow flies, with
no objective point and no errand, a village inn or a shepherd's hut at
night, with a crone to sing them an old ballad over the fire, or a group
of hardy dalesmen to welcome them with stories and carousal&mdash;these were
blithe adventurous days such as could not fail to ripen Scott's already
ardent nature, and store his memory with genial knowledge. The account
of Dandie Dinmont given by Mr. Shortreed may be taken as a picture, only
too true in some of its touches, of Scott in these youthful escapades:
"Eh me, ... sic an endless fund of humor and drollery as he had then wi'
him. Never ten yards but we were either laughing or roaring and singing.
Wherever we stopped how brawlie he suited himsel' to everybody! He aye
did as the lave did; never made himsel' the great man or took ony airs
in the company. I've seen him in a' moods in these jaunts, grave and
gay, daft and serious, sober and drunk&mdash;(this, however, even in our
wildest rambles, was but rare)&mdash;but drunk or sober, he was aye the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
gentleman. He looked excessively heavy and stupid when he was fou, but
he was never out o' gude humor." After this, we are not surprised to
hear that Scott's father told him disgustedly that he was better fitted
to be a fiddling peddler, a "gangrel scrape-gut," than a respectable
attorney. As a matter of fact, however, behind the mad pranks and the
occasional excesses there was a very serious purpose in all this
scouring of the country-side. Scott was picking up here and there, from
the old men and women with whom he hobnobbed, antiquarian material of an
invaluable kind, bits of local history, immemorial traditions and
superstitions, and, above all, precious ballads which had been handed
down for generations among the peasantry. These ballads, thus
precariously transmitted, it was Scott's ambition to gather together and
preserve, and he spared no pains or fatigue to come at any scrap of
ballad literature of whose existence he had an inkling. Meanwhile, he
was enriching heart and imagination for the work that was before him. So
that here also, though in the hair-brained and heady way of youth, he
was engaged in his task of preparation.</p>

<p>Scott has told us that it was his reading of <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span> which
determined him to be an author, but he was first actually excited to
composition in another way. This was by hearing recited a ballad of the
German poet Bürger, entitled <span class="italic">Lenore</span>, in which a skeleton lover carries
off his bride to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> wedding in the land of death. Mr. Hutton remarks
upon the curiousness of the fact that a piece of "raw supernaturalism"
like this should have appealed so strongly to a mind as healthy and sane
as Scott's. So it was, however. He could not rid himself of the
fascination of the piece until he had translated it, and published it,
together with another translation from the same author. One stanza at
least of this first effort of Scott sounds a note characteristic of his
poetry:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tramp! tramp! along the land they rode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Splash! splash! along the sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scourge is red, the spur drops blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flashing pebbles flee.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here we catch the trumpet-like clang and staccato tramp of verse which
he was soon to use in a way to thrill his generation. This tiny pamphlet
of verse, Scott's earliest publication, appeared in 1796. Soon after, he
met Monk Lewis, then famous as a purveyor to English palates of the
crude horrors which German romanticism had just ceased to revel in.
Lewis was engaged in compiling a book of supernatural stories and poems
under the title of <span class="italic">Tales of Wonder</span>, and asked Scott to contribute.
Scott wrote for this book three long ballads&mdash;"Glenfinlas," "Cadyow
Castle," and "The Gray Brother." Though tainted with the conventional
diction of eighteenth century verse, these ballads are not unimpressive
pieces of work; the second named, especially, shows a kind and degree of
romantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> imagination such as his later poetry rather substantiated than
newly revealed.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>In the following year, 1797, Scott married a Miss Charpentier, daughter
of a French refugee. She was not his first love, that place having been
usurped by a Miss Stuart Belches, for whom Scott had felt perhaps the
only deep passion of his life, and memory of whom was to come to the
surface touchingly in his old age. Miss Charpentier, or Carpenter, as
she was called, with her vivacity and quaint foreign speech "caught his
heart on the rebound"; there can be no doubt that, in spite of a certain
shallowness of character, she made him a good wife, and that his
affection for her deepened steadily to the end. The young couple went to
live at Lasswade, a village near Edinburgh, on the Esk. Scott, in whom
the proprietary instinct was always very strong, took great pride in the
pretty little cottage. He made a dining-table for it with his own hands,
planted saplings in the yard, and drew together two willow-trees at the
gate into a kind of arch, surmounted by a cross made of two sticks.
"After I had constructed this," he says, "mamma (Mrs. Scott) and I both
of us thought it so fine that we turned out to see it by moonlight, and
walked backwards from it to the cottage door, in admiration of our
magnificence and its picturesque effect." It would have been well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
indeed for them both if their pleasures of proprietorship could always
have remained so touchingly simple.</p>

<p>Now that he was married, Scott was forced to look a little more sharply
to his fortunes. He applied himself with more determination to the law.
In 1799 he became deputy-sheriff of Selkirkshire, with a salary of three
hundred pounds, which placed him at least beyond the reach of want. He
began to look more and more to literature as a means of supplementing
his income. His ballads in the <span class="italic">Tales of Wonder</span> had gained him some
reputation; this he increased in 1802 by the publication, under the
title <span class="italic">Border Minstrelsy</span>, of the ballads which he had for several years
been collecting, collating, and richly annotating. Meanwhile he was
looking about for a congenial subject upon which to try his hand in a
larger way than he had as yet adventured. Such a subject came to him at
last in a manner calculated to enlist all his enthusiasm in its
treatment, for it was given him by the Countess of Dalkeith, wife of the
heir-apparent to the dukedom of Buccleugh. The ducal house of Buccleugh
stood at the head of the clan Scott, and toward its representative the
poet always held himself in an attitude of feudal reverence. The Duke of
Buccleugh was his "chief," entitled to demand from him both passive
loyalty and active service; so, at least, Scott loved to interpret their
relationship, making effective in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> his own case a feudal sentiment which
had elsewhere somewhat lapsed. He especially loved to think of himself
as the bard of his clan, a modern representative of those rude poets
whom the Scottish chiefs once kept as a part of their household to chant
the exploits of the clan. Nothing could have pleased his fancy more,
therefore, than a request on the part of the lady of his chief to treat
a subject of her assigning&mdash;namely, the dark mischief-making of a dwarf
or goblin who had strayed from his unearthly master and attached himself
as page to a human household. The subject fell in with the poet's
reigning taste for strong supernaturalism. Gilpin Horner, the goblin
page, though he proved in the sequel a difficult character to put to
poetic use, was a figure grotesque and eerie enough to appeal even to
Monk Lewis. At first Scott thought of treating the subject in
ballad-form, but the scope of treatment was gradually enlarged by
several circumstances. To begin with, he chanced upon a copy of Goethe's
<span class="italic">Götz von Berlichingen</span>, and the history of that robber baron suggested
to him the feasibility of throwing the same vivid light upon the old
Border life of his ancestors as Goethe had thrown upon that of the Rhine
barons. This led him to subordinate the part played by the goblin page
in the proposed story, which was now widened to include elaborate
pictures of medieval life and manners, and to lay the scene in the
castle of Branksome, formerly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> stronghold of Scott's and the Duke of
Buccleugh's ancestors. The verse form into which the story was thrown
was due to a still more accidental circumstance, i.e., Scott's
overhearing Sir John Stoddard recite a fragment of Coleridge's
unpublished poem "Christabel." The placing of the story in the mouth of
an old harper fallen upon evil days, was a happy afterthought; besides
making a beautiful framework for the main poem, it enabled the author to
escape criticism for any violent innovations of style, since these could
always be attributed to the rude and wild school of poetry to which the
harper was supposed to belong. In these ways <span class="italic">The Lay of the Last
Minstrel</span> gradually developed in its present form. Upon its publication
in 1805, it achieved an immediate success. The vividness of its
descriptive passages, the buoyant rush of its meter, the deep romantic
glow suffusing all its pages, took by storm a public familiar to
weariness with the decorous abstractions of the eighteenth century
poets. The first edition, a sumptuous quarto, was exhausted in a few
weeks; an octavo edition of fifteen hundred was sold out within the
year; and before 1830, forty-four thousand copies were needed to supply
the popular demand. Scott received in all something under eight hundred
pounds for the <span class="italic">Lay</span>, a small amount when contrasted with his gains from
subsequent poems, but a sum so unusual nevertheless that he determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
forthwith to devote as much time to literature as he could spare from
his legal duties; those he still placed foremost, for until near the
close of his life he clung to his adage that literature was "a good
staff, but a poor crutch."</p>

<p>A year before the publication of the <span class="italic">Lay</span>, Scott had removed to the
small country seat of Ashestiel, in Selkirkshire, seven miles from the
nearest town, Selkirk, and several miles from any neighbor. In the
introductions to the various cantos of <span class="italic">Marmion</span> he has given us a
delightful picture of Ashestiel and its surroundings&mdash;the swift
Glenkinnon dashing through the estate in a deep ravine, on its way to
join the Tweed; behind the house the rising hills beyond which lay the
lovely scenery of the Yarrow. The eight years (1804&ndash;1812) at Ashestiel
were the serenest, and probably the happiest, of Scott's life. Here he
wrote his two greatest poems, <span class="italic">Marmion</span> and <span class="italic">The Lady of the Lake</span>. His
mornings he spent at his desk, always with a faithful hound at his feet
watching the tireless hand as it threw off sheet after sheet of
manuscript to make up the day's stint. By one o'clock he was, as he
said, "his own man," free to spend the remaining hours of light with his
children, his horses, and his dogs, or to indulge himself in his
life-long passion for tree-planting. His robust and healthy nature made
him excessively fond of all out-of-door sports, especially riding, in
which he was daring to foolhardiness. It is a curious fact, noted by
Lockhart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> that many of Scott's senses were blunt; he could scarcely,
for instance, tell one wine from another by the taste, and once sat
quite unconscious at his table while his guests were manifesting extreme
uneasiness over the approach of a too-long-kept haunch of venison, but
his sight was unusually keen, as his hunting exploits proved. His little
son once explained his father's popularity by saying that "it was him
that commonly saw the hare sitting." What with hunting, fishing,
salmon-spearing by torchlight, gallops over the hills into the Yarrow
country, planting and transplanting of his beloved trees, Scott's life
at Ashestiel, during the hours when he was "his own man," was a very
full and happy one.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, he had already embarked in an enterprise which was
destined to overthrow his fortunes just when they seemed fairest. While
at school in Kelso he had become intimate with a school fellow named
James Ballantyne, and later, when Ballantyne set up a small printing
house in Kelso, he had given him his earliest poems to print. After the
issue of the <span class="italic">Border Minstrelsy</span>, the typographical excellence of which
attracted attention even in London, he set Ballantyne up in business in
Edinburgh, secretly entering the firm himself as silent partner. The
good sale of the <span class="italic">Lay</span> had given the firm an excellent start; but more
matter was presently needed to feed the press. To supply it, Scott
undertook and completed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> Ashestiel four enormous tasks of
editing&mdash;the complete works of Dryden and of Swift, the Somers' Tracts,
and the Sadler State Papers. The success of these editions, and the
subsequent enormous sale of Scott's poems and novels, would have kept
the concern solvent in spite of Ballantyne's complete incapacity for
business, but in 1809 Scott plunged recklessly into another and more
serious venture. A dispute with Constable, the veteran publisher and
bookseller, aggravated by the harsh criticism delivered upon <span class="italic">Marmion</span>
by Francis Jeffrey, editor of the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, Constable's
magazine, determined Scott to set up in connection with the Ballantyne
press a rival bookselling concern, and a rival magazine, to be called
the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>. The project was a daring one, in view of
Constable's great ability and resources; to make it foolhardy to madness
Scott selected to manage the new business a brother of James Ballantyne,
a dissipated little buffoon, with about as much business ability and
general caliber of character as is connoted by the name which Scott
coined for him, "Rigdumfunnidos." The selection of such a man for such a
place betrays in Scott's eminently sane and balanced mind a curious
strain of impracticality, to say the least; indeed, we are almost
constrained to feel with his harsher critics that it betrays something
worse than defective judgment&mdash;defective character. His greatest
failing, if failing it can be called, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> pride. He could not endure
even the mild dictations of a competent publisher, as is shown by his
answer to a letter written by one of them proposing some salaried work;
he replied curtly that he was a "black Hussar" of literature, and not to
be put to such tame service. Probably this haughty dislike of dictation,
this imperious desire to patronize rather than be patronized, led him to
choose inferior men with whom to enter into business relations. If so,
he paid for the fault so dearly that it is hard for a biographer to
press the issue against him.</p>

<p>For the present, however, the wind of fortune was blowing fair, and all
the storm clouds were below the horizon. In 1808 <span class="italic">Marmion</span> appeared, and
was greeted with an enthusiasm which made the unprecedented reception of
the <span class="italic">Lay</span> seem lukewarm in comparison. <span class="italic">Marmion</span> contains nothing which
was not plainly foreshadowed in the <span class="italic">Lay</span>, but the hand of the poet has
grown more sure, his descriptive effects are less crude and amateurish,
the narrative proceeds with a steadier march, the music has gained in
volume and in martial vigor. An anecdote is told by Mr. Hutton which
will serve as a type of a hundred others illustrative of the
extraordinary hold which this poetry took upon the minds of ordinary
men. "I have heard," he says, "of two old men&mdash;complete
strangers&mdash;passing each other on a dark London night, when one of them
happened to be repeating to himself, just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> Campbell did to the
hackney coachman of the North Bridge of Edinburgh, the last lines of the
account of Flodden Field in <span class="italic">Marmion</span>, 'Charge, Chester, charge,' when
suddenly a reply came out of the darkness, 'On, Stanley, on,' whereupon
they finished the death of <span class="italic">Marmion</span> between them, took off their hats
to each other, and parted, laughing." <span class="italic">The Lady of the Lake</span>, which
followed in little more than a year, was received with the same popular
delight, and with even greater respect on the part of the critics. Even
the formidable Jeffrey, who was supposed to dine off slaughtered authors
as the Giant in "Jack and the Beanstalk" dined off young Englishmen,
keyed his voice to unwonted praise. The influx of tourists into the
Trossachs, where the scene of the poem was laid, was so great as
seriously to embarrass the mail coaches, until at last the posting
charges had to be raised in order to diminish the traffic. Far away in
Spain, at a trying moment of the Peninsular campaign, Sir Adam Ferguson,
posted on a point of ground exposed to the enemy's fire, read to his men
as they lay prostrate on the ground the passage from <span class="italic">The Lady of the
Lake</span> describing the combat between Roderick Dhu's Highlanders and the
forces of the Earl of Mar; and "the listening soldiers only interrupted
him by a joyous huzza when the French shot struck the bank close above
them." Such tributes&mdash;and they were legion&mdash;to the power of his poetry
to move adventurous and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> hardy men, must have been intoxicating to
Scott; there is small wonder that the success of his poems gave him, as
he says, "such a <span class="italic">heeze</span> as almost lifted him off his feet."</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Scott's modesty was not in danger, but so far as his prudence was
concerned, his success did really lift him off his feet. In 1812, still
more encouraged thereto by entering upon the emoluments of the office of
Clerk of Sessions, the duties of which he had performed for six years
without pay, he purchased Abbotsford, an estate on the Tweed, adjoining
that of the Duke of Buccleugh, his kinsman, and near the beautiful ruins
of Melrose Abbey. Here he began to carry out the dream of his life, to
found a territorial family which should augment the power and fame of
his clan. Beginning with a modest farm house and a farm of a hundred
acres, he gradually bought, planted, and built, until the farm became a
manorial domain and the farm house a castle. He had not gone far in this
work before he began to realize that the returns from his poetry would
never suffice to meet such demands as would thus be made upon his purse.
Byron's star was in the ascendant, and before its baleful magnificence
Scott's milder and more genial light visibly paled. He was himself the
first to declare, with characteristic generosity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> that the younger poet
had "bet"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> him at his own craft. As Carlyle says, "he had held the
sovereignty for some half-score of years, a comparatively long lease of
it, and now the time seemed come for dethronement, for abdication. An
unpleasant business; which, however, he held himself ready, as a brave
man will, to transact with composure and in silence."</p>

<p>But, as it proved, there was no need for resignation. The reign of
metrical romance, brilliant but brief, was past, or nearly so. But what
of prose romance, which long ago, in picking out <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span> from the
puzzling Spanish, he had promised himself he would one day attempt? With
some such questioning of the Fates, Scott drew from his desk the sheets
of a story begun seven years before, and abandoned because of the
success of <span class="italic">The Lay of the Last Minstrel</span>. This story he now completed,
and published as <span class="italic">Waverley</span> in the spring of 1814&mdash;an event "memorable
in the annals of British literature; in the annals of British
bookselling thrice and four times memorable." The popularity of the
metrical romances dwindled to insignificance before the enthusiasm with
which this prose romance was received. A moment before quietly resolved
to give up his place in the world's eye, and to live the life of an
obscure country gentleman, Scott found himself launched once more on the
tide of brave fortunes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> The Ballantyne publishing and printing houses
ceased to totter, and settled themselves on what seemed the firmest of
foundations. At Abbotsford, buying, planting, and building began on a
greater scale than had ever been planned in its owner's most sanguine
moments.</p>

<p>The history of the next eleven years in Scott's life is the history, on
the one hand, of the rapidly-appearing novels, of a fame gradually
spreading outward from Great Britain until it covered the civilized
world&mdash;a fame increased rather than diminished by the <span class="italic">incognito</span> which
the "author of <span class="italic">Waverley</span>" took great pains to preserve even after the
secret had become an open one; on the other hand, of the large-hearted,
hospitable life at Abbotsford, where, in spite of the importunities of
curious and ill-bred tourists, bent on getting a glimpse of the "Wizard
of the North," and in spite of the enormous mass of work, literary and
official, which Scott took upon himself to perform, the atmosphere of
country leisure and merriment was somehow miraculously preserved. This
life of the hearty prosperous country laird was the one toward the
realization of which all Scott's efforts were directed; it is worth
while, therefore, to see as vividly as may be, what kind of life that
was, that we may the better understand what kind of man he was who cared
for it. The following extract from Lockhart's <span class="italic">Life of Scott</span> gives us
at least one very characteristic aspect of the Abbotsford world:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>"It was a clear, bright September morning, with a sharpness in the
air that doubled the animating influence of the sunshine; and all
was in readiness for a grand coursing-match on Newark Hill. The
only guest who had chalked out other sport for himself was the
staunchest of anglers, Mr. Rose; but he, too, was there on his
<span class="italic">shelty</span>, armed with his salmon-rod and landing-net.... This little
group of Waltonians, bound for Lord Somerville's preserve, remained
lounging about, to witness the start of the main cavalcade. Sir
Walter, mounted on Sibyl, was marshalling the order of procession
with a huge hunting-whip; and among a dozen frolicsome youths and
maidens, who seemed disposed to laugh at all discipline, appeared,
each on horseback, each as eager as the youngest sportsman in the
troop, Sir Humphrey Davy, Dr. Wollaston, and the patriarch of
Scottish belles-lettres, Henry Mackenzie.... Laidlow (the steward
of Abbotsford) on a strong-tailed wiry Highlander, yclept Hoddin
Grey, which carried him nimbly and stoutly, although his feet
almost touched the ground, was the adjutant. But the most
picturesque figure was the illustrious inventor of the safety-lamp
(Sir Humphrey Davy) ... a brown hat with flexible brim, surrounded
with line upon line of catgut, and innumerable fly-hooks; jackboots
worthy of a Dutch smuggler, and a fustian surtout dabbled with the
blood of salmon, made a fine contrast with the smart jacket,
white-cord breeches, and well-polished jockey-boots of the less
distinguished cavaliers about him. Dr. Wollaston was in black; and
with his noble serene dignity of countenance might have passed for
a sporting archbishop. Mr. Mackenzie, at this time in the
seventy-sixth year of his age, with a hat turned up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> with green,
green spectacles, green jacket, and long brown leathern gaiters
buttoned upon his nether anatomy, wore a dog-whistle round his
neck.... Tom Purdie (one of Scott's servants) and his subalterns
had preceded us by a few hours with all the grey-hounds that could
be collected at Abbotsford, Darnick, and Melrose; but the giant
Maida had remained as his master's orderly, and now gamboled about
Sibyl Grey barking for mere joy like a spaniel puppy.</p>

<p>"The order of march had all been settled, when Scott's daughter
Anne broke from the line, screaming with laughter, and exclaimed,
'Papa, papa, I knew you could never think of going without your
pet!' Scott looked round, and I rather think there was a blush as
well as a smile upon his face, when he perceived a little black pig
frisking about his pony, evidently a self-elected addition to the
party of the day. He tried to look stern, and cracked his whip at
the creature, but was in a moment obliged to join in the general
cheers. Poor piggy soon found a strap round its neck, and was
dragged into the background; Scott, watching the retreat, repeated
with mock pathos, the first verse of an old pastoral song&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What will I do gin my hoggie die?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My joy, my pride, my hoggie!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My only beast, I had na mae,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wow, but I was vogie!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&mdash;the cheers were redoubled&mdash;and the squadron moved on."</p></blockquote>

<p>Let us supplement this with one more picture, from the same hand,
showing Scott in a little more intimate light. The passage was written
in 1821, after Lockhart had married Scott's eldest daughter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> and gone
to spend the summer at Chiefswood, a cottage on the Abbotsford estate:</p>

<blockquote><p>"We were near enough Abbotsford to partake as often as we liked of
its brilliant and constantly varying society; yet could do so
without being exposed to the worry and exhaustion of spirit which
the daily reception of new-comers entailed upon all the family,
except Scott himself. But in truth, even he was not always proof
against the annoyances connected with such a style of open
house-keeping.... When sore beset at home in this way, he would
every now and then discover that he had some very particular
business to attend to on an outlying part of his estate, and
craving the indulgence of his guests overnight, appear at the cabin
in the glen before its inhabitants were astir in the morning. The
clatter of Sibyl Grey's hoofs, the yelping of Mustard and Spice,
and his own joyous shout of <span class="italic">réveillée</span> under our windows, were the
signal that he had burst his toils, and meant for that day to 'take
his ease in his inn.' On descending, he was found to be seated with
all his dogs and ours about him, under a spreading ash that
overshadowed half the bank between the cottage and the brook,
pointing the edge of his woodman's axe, and listening to Tom
Purdie's lecture touching the plantation that most needed thinning.
After breakfast he would take possession of a dressing-room
upstairs, and write a chapter of <span class="italic">The Pirate</span>; and then, having
made up and despatched his packet for Mr. Ballantyne, away to join
Purdie wherever the foresters were at work ... until it was time to
rejoin his own party at Abbotsford or the quiet circle of the
cottage. When his guests were few and friendly, he often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> made them
come over and meet him at Chiefswood in a body towards evening....
He was ready with all sorts of devices to supply the wants of a
narrow establishment; he used to delight particularly in sinking
the wine in a well under the <span class="italic">brae</span> ere he went out, and hauling up
the basket just before dinner was announced,&mdash;this primitive device
being, he said, what he had always practised when a young
housekeeper, and in his opinion far superior in its results to any
application of ice; and in the same spirit, whenever the weather
was sufficiently genial, he voted for dining out of doors
altogether."</p></blockquote>

<p>Few events of importance except the successive appearances of "our
buiks" as Tom Purdie called his master's novels, and an occasional visit
to London or the continent, intervened to break the busy monotony of
this Abbotsford life. On one of these visits to London, Scott was
invited to dine with the Prince Regent, and when the prince became King
George IV, in 1820, almost the first act of his reign was to create
Scott a baronet. Scott accepted the honor gratefully, as coming, he
said, "from the original source of all honor." There can well be two
opinions as to whether this least admirable of English kings constituted
a very prime fountain of honor, judged by democratic standards; but to
Scott's mind, such an imputation would have been next to sacrilege. The
feudal bias of his mind, strong to start with, had been strengthened by
his long sojourn among the visions of a feudal past; the ideals of
feudalism were living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> realities to him; and he accepted knighthood from
his king's hand in exactly the same spirit which determined his attitude
of humility towards his "chief," the Duke of Buccleugh, and which
impelled him to exhaust his genius in the effort to build up a great
family estate.</p>

<p>There were already signs that the enormous burden of work under which he
seemed to move so lightly, was telling on him. <span class="italic">The Bride of
Lammermoor</span>, <span class="italic">The Legend of Montrose</span>, and <span class="italic">Ivanhoe</span>, had all of them
been dictated between screams of pain, wrung from his lips by a chronic
cramp of the stomach. By the time he reached <span class="italic">Redgauntlet</span> and <span class="italic">St.
Ronan's Well</span>, there began to be heard faint murmurings of discontent
from his public, hints that he was writing too fast, and that the noble
wine he had poured them for so long was growing at last a trifle watery.
To add to these causes of uneasiness, the commercial ventures in which
he was interested drifted again into a precarious state. He had himself
fallen into the bad habit of forestalling the gains from his novels by
heavy drafts on his publishers, and the example thus set was followed
faithfully by John Ballantyne. Scott's good humor and his partner's bad
judgment saddled the concern with a lot of unsalable books. In 1818 the
affairs of the book-selling business had to be closed up, Constable
taking over the unsalable stock and assuming the outstanding liabilities
in return for copyright privileges covering some of Scott's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> novels.
This so burdened the veteran publisher that when, in 1825, a large
London firm failed, it carried him down also&mdash;and with him James
Ballantyne, with whom he had entered into close relations. Scott's
secret connection with Ballantyne had continued; accordingly he woke up
one fine day to find himself worse than beggared, being personally
liable for one hundred and thirty thousand pounds.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The years intervening between this calamity and Scott's death form one
of the saddest and at the same time most heroic chapters in the history
of literature. The fragile health of Lady Scott succumbed almost
immediately to the crushing blow, and she died in a few months. Scott
surrendered Abbotsford to his creditors and took up humble lodgings in
Edinburgh. Here, with a pride and stoical courage as quiet as it was
splendid, he settled down to fill with the earnings of his pen the vast
gulf of debt for which he was morally scarcely responsible at all. In
three years he wrote <span class="italic">Woodstock</span>, three <span class="italic">Chronicles of the Canongate</span>,
the <span class="italic">Fair Maid of Perth</span>, <span class="italic">Anne of Geierstein</span>, the first series of the
<span class="italic">Tales of a Grandfather</span>, and a <span class="italic">Life of Napoleon</span>, equal to thirteen
volumes of novel size, besides editing and annotating a complete edition
of his own works. All these together netted his creditors £40,000.
Touched by the efforts he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> making to settle their claims, they now
presented him with Abbotsford, and thither he returned to spend the few
years remaining to him. In 1830 he suffered a first stroke of paralysis;
refusing to give up, however, he made one more desperate rally to
recapture his old power of story-telling. <span class="italic">Count Robert of Paris</span> and
<span class="italic">Castle Dangerous</span> were the pathetic result; they are not to be taken
into account, in any estimate of his powers, for they are manifestly the
work of a paralytic patient. The gloomy picture is darkened by an
incident which illustrates strikingly one phase of Scott's character.</p>

<p>The great Reform Bill was being discussed throughout Scotland, menacing
what were really abuses, but what Scott, with his intense conservatism,
believed to be sacred and inviolable institutions. The dying man roused
himself to make a stand against the abominable bill. In a speech which
he made at Jedburgh, he was hissed and hooted by the crowd, and he left
the town with the dastardly cry of "Burk Sir Walter!" ringing in his
ears.</p>

<p>Nature now intervened to ease the intolerable strain. Scott's anxiety
concerning his debt gradually gave way to an hallucination that it had
all been paid. His friends took advantage of the quietude which followed
to induce him to make the journey to Italy, in the fear that the severe
winter of Scotland would prove fatal. A ship of His Majesty's fleet was
put at his disposal, and he set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> sail for Malta. The youthful
adventurousness of the man flared up again oddly for a moment, when he
insisted on being set ashore upon a volcanic island in the Mediterranean
which had appeared but a few days before and which sank beneath the
surface shortly after. The climate of Malta at first appeared to benefit
him; but when he heard, one day, of the death of Goethe at Weimar, he
seemed seized with a sudden apprehension of his own end, and insisted
upon hurrying back through Europe, in order that he might look once more
on Abbotsford. On the ride from Edinburgh he remained for the first two
stages entirely unconscious. But as the carriage entered the valley of
the Gala he opened his eyes and murmured the name of objects as they
passed, "Gala water, surely&mdash;Buckholm&mdash;Torwoodlee." When the towers of
Abbotsford came in view, he was so filled with delight that he could
scarcely be restrained from leaping out. At the gates he greeted
faithful Laidlaw in a voice strong and hearty as of old: "Why, man, how
often I have thought of you!" and smiled and wept over the dogs who came
rushing as in bygone times to lick his hand. He died a few days later,
on the afternoon of a glorious autumn day, with all the windows open, so
that he might catch to the last the whisper of the Tweed over its
pebbles.</p>

<p>"And so," says Carlyle, "the curtain falls; and the strong Walter Scott
is with us no more. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> possession from him does remain; widely
scattered; yet attainable; not inconsiderable. It can be said of him,
when he departed, he took a Man's life along with him. No sounder piece
of British manhood was put together in that eighteenth century of Time.
Alas, his fine Scotch face, with its shaggy honesty, sagacity and
goodness, when we saw it latterly on the Edinburgh streets, was all worn
with care, the joy all fled from it&mdash;plowed deep with labor and sorrow.
We shall never forget it; we shall never see it again. Adieu, Sir
Walter, pride of all Scotchmen, take our proud and sad farewell."</p>

<a name="II_SCOTTS_PLACE_IN_THE_ROMANTIC_MOVEMENT" id="II_SCOTTS_PLACE_IN_THE_ROMANTIC_MOVEMENT"></a>II. SCOTT'S PLACE IN THE ROMANTIC MOVEMENT</h2>


<p>In order rightly to appreciate the poetry of Scott it is necessary to
understand something of that remarkable "Romantic Movement" which took
place toward the end of the eighteenth century, and within a space of
twenty-five years completely changed the face of English literature.
Both the causes and the effects of this movement were much more than
merely literary; the "romantic revival" penetrated every crevice and
ramification of life in those parts of Europe which it affected; its
social, political, and religious results were all deeply significant.
But we must here confine ourselves to such aspects of the revival as
showed themselves in English poetry.</p>

<p>Eighteenth century poetry had been distinguished by its polish, its
formal correctness, or&mdash;to use a term in much favor with critics of that
day&mdash;its "elegance." The various and wayward metrical effects of the
Elizabethan and Jacobean poets had been discarded for a few
well-recognized verse forms, which themselves in turn had become still
further limited by the application to them of precise rules of
structure. Hand in hand with this restricting process in meter, had gone
a similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> tendency in diction. The simple, concrete phrases of daily
speech had given way to stately periphrases; the rich and riotous
vocabulary of earlier poetry had been replaced by one more decorous,
measured, and high-sounding. A corresponding process of selection and
exclusion was applied to the subject matter of poetry. Passion, lyric
exaltation, delight in the concrete life of man and nature, passed out
of fashion; in their stead came social satire, criticism, generalized
observation. While the classical influence, as it is usually called, was
at its height, with such men as Dryden and Pope to exemplify it, it did
a great work; but toward the end of the eighth decade of the eighteenth
century it had visibly run to seed. The feeble Hayley, the silly Della
Crusca, the arid Erasmus Darwin, were its only exemplars. England was
ripe for a literary revolution, a return to nature and to passion; and
such a revolution was not slow in coming.</p>

<p>It announced itself first in George Crabbe, who turned to paint the life
of the poor with patient realism; in Burns, who poured out in his songs
the passion of love, the passion of sorrow, the passion of conviviality;
in Blake, who tried to reach across the horizon of visible fact to
mystical heavens of more enduring reality. Following close upon these
men came the four poets destined to accomplish the revolution which the
early comers had begun. They were born within four years of each other,
Wordsworth in 1770, Scott in 1771, Coleridge in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> 1772, Southey in 1774.
As we look at these four men now, and estimate their worth as poets, we
see that Southey drops almost out of the account, and that Wordsworth
and Coleridge stand, so far as the highest qualities of poetry go, far
above Scott, as, indeed, Blake and Burns do also. But the contemporary
judgment upon them was directly the reverse; and Scott's poetry
exercised an influence over his age immeasurably greater than that of
any of the other three. Let us attempt to discover what qualities this
poetry possessed which gave it its astonishing hold upon the age when it
was written. In so doing, we may discover indirectly some of the reasons
why it still retains a large portion of its popularity, and perhaps
arrive at some grounds of judgment by which we may test its right
thereto.</p>

<p>One reason why Scott's poetry was immediately welcomed, while that of
Wordsworth and of Coleridge lay neglected, is to be found in the fact
that in the matter of diction Scott was much less revolutionary than
they. By nature and education he was conservative; he put <span class="italic">The Lay of
the Last Minstrel</span> into the mouth of a rude harper of the North in order
to shield himself from the charge of "attempting to set up a new school
in poetry," and he never throughout his life violated the conventions,
literary or social, if he could possibly avoid doing so. This bias
toward conservatism and conventionality shows itself particularly in
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> language of his poems. He was compelled, of course, to use much
more concrete and vivid terms than the eighteenth century poets had
used, because he was dealing with much more concrete and vivid matter;
but his language, nevertheless, has a prevailing stateliness, and at
times an artificiality, which recommended it to readers tired of the
inanities of Hayley and Mason, but unwilling to accept the startling
simplicity and concreteness of diction exemplified by the Lake poets at
their best.</p>

<p>Another peculiarity of Scott's poetry which made powerfully for its
popularity, was its spirited meter. People were weary of the heroic
couplet, and turned eagerly to these hurried verses, that went on their
way with the sharp tramp of moss-troopers, and heated the blood like a
drum. The meters of Coleridge, subtle, delicate, and poignant, had been
passed by with indifference&mdash;had not been heard perhaps, for lack of
ears trained to hear; but Scott's metrical effects were such as a child
could appreciate, and a soldier could carry in his head.</p>

<p>Analogous to this treatment of meter, though belonging to a less formal
side of his art, was Scott's treatment of nature, the landscape setting
of his stories. Perhaps the most obvious feature of the romantic revival
was a reawakening of interest in out-door nature. It was as if for a
hundred years past people had been stricken blind as soon as they passed
from the city streets into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> the country. A trim garden, an artfully
placed country house, a well-kept preserve, they might see; but for the
great shaggy world of mountain and sea&mdash;it had been shut out of man's
elegant vision. Before Scott began to write there had been no lack of
prophets of the new nature-worship, but none of them of a sort to catch
the general ear. Wordsworth's pantheism was too mystical, too delicate
and intuitive, to recommend itself to any but chosen spirits; Crabbe's
descriptions were too minute, Coleridge's too intense, to please. Scott
was the first to paint nature with a broad, free touch, without raptures
or philosophizing, but with a healthy pleasure in its obvious beauties,
such as appeal to average men. His "scenery" seldom exists for its own
sake, but serves, as it should, for background and setting of his story.
As his readers followed the fortunes of William of Deloraine or Roderick
Dhu, they traversed by sunlight and by moonlight landscapes of wild
romantic charm, and felt their beauty quite naturally, as a part of the
excitement of that wild life. They felt it the more readily because of a
touch of artificial stateliness in the handling, a slight theatrical
heightening of effect&mdash;from an absolute point of view a defect, but
highly congenial to the taste of the time. It was the scenic side of
nature which Scott gave, and gave inimitably, while Burns was piercing
to the inner heart of her tenderness in his lines "To a Mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> Daisy"
and "To a Mouse," while Wordsworth was mystically communing with her
soul, in his "Tintern Abbey." It was the scenic side of nature for which
the perceptions of men were ripe; so they left profounder poets to their
musings, and followed after the poet who could give them a brilliant
story set in a brilliant scene.</p>

<p>Again, the emotional key to Scott's poetry was on a comprehensible
plane. The situations with which he deals, the passions, ambitions,
satisfactions, which he portrays, belong, in one form or another, to all
men, or at least are easily grasped by the imaginations of all men. It
has often been said that Scott is the most Homeric of English poets; so
far as the claim rests on considerations of style, it is hardly to be
granted, for nothing could be farther than the hurrying torrent of
Scott's verse from the "long and refluent music" of Homer. But in this
other respect, that he deals in the rudimentary stuff of human character
in a straightforward way, without a hint of modern complexities and
super-subtleties, he is really akin to the master poet of antiquity.
This, added to the crude wild life which he pictures, the vigorous sweep
of his action, the sincere glow of romance which bathes his story&mdash;all
so tonic in their effect upon minds long used to the stuffy decorum of
didactic poetry, completed the triumph of <span class="italic">The Lay of the Last
Minstrel</span>, <span class="italic">Marmion</span>, and <span class="italic">The Lady of the Lake</span>, over their age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>As has been already suggested, Scott cannot be put in the first rank of
poets. No compromise can be made on this point, because upon it the
whole theory of poetry depends. Neither on the formal nor on the
essential sides of his art is he among the small company of the supreme.
And no one understood this better than himself. He touched the keynote
of his own power, though with too great modesty, when he said, "I am
sensible that if there is anything good about my poetry ... it is a
hurried frankness of composition which pleases soldiers, sailors, and
young people of bold and active dispositions." The poet Campbell, who
was so fascinated by Scott's ballad of "Cadyow Castle" that he used to
repeat it aloud on the North Bridge of Edinburgh until "the whole
fraternity of coachmen knew him by tongue as he passed," characterizes
the predominant charm of Scott's poetry as lying in a "strong, pithy
eloquence," which is perhaps only another name for "hurried frankness of
composition." If this is not the highest quality to which poetry can
attain, it is a very admirable one; and it will be a sad day for the
English-speaking race when there shall not be found persons of every age
and walk of life, to take the same delights in these stirring poems as
their author loved to think was taken by "soldiers, sailors, and young
people of bold and active dispositions."</p>

III. THE LADY OF THE LAKE</h2>


<h3><a name="HISTORICAL_SETTING" id="HISTORICAL_SETTING"></a>1. HISTORICAL SETTING</h3>

<p><span class="italic">The Lady of the Lake</span> deals with a distinct epoch in the life of King
James V of Scotland, and has lying back of it a considerable amount of
historical fact, an understanding of which will help in the appreciation
of the poem. During his minority the King was under the tutelage of
Archibald Douglas, sixth Earl of Angus, who had married the King's
mother. The young monarch chafed for a long time under this authority,
but the Douglases were so powerful that he was unable to shake it off,
in spite of several desperate attempts on the part of his sympathizers
to rescue him. In 1528 the King, then sixteen years of age, escaped from
his own castle of Falkland to Stirling Castle. The governor of Stirling,
an enemy of the Douglas family, received him joyfully. There soon
gathered about his standard a sufficient number of powerful peers to
enable him to depose the Earl of Angus from the regency and to banish
him and all his family to England. The Douglas who figures in the poem
is an imaginary uncle of the banished regent, and himself under the ban,
compelled to hide away in the shelter provided for him by Roderick Dhu
on the lonely island in Loch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> Katrine. He is represented as having been
loved and trusted by King James during the boyhood of the latter, before
the enmity sprang up between the house of Angus and the throne. This
enmity, to quote from the <span class="italic">History of the House of Douglas</span>, published
at Edinburgh in 1743, "was so inveterate, that numerous as their allies
were, their nearest friends, even in the most remote parts of Scotland,
durst not entertain them, unless under the strictest and closest
disguise."</p>

<p>The outlawed border chieftain, Roderick Dhu, who gives shelter to the
persecuted Douglas, is a fictitious character, but one entirely typical
of the time and place. The expedition undertaken by the young King
against the Border clans, under the guise of a hunting party, is in
part, at least, historic. Pitscottie's History says: "In 1529 James V
made a convention at Edinburgh for the purpose of considering the best
mode of quelling the Border robbers, who, during the license of his
minority and the troubles which followed, had committed many
exorbitances. Accordingly, he assembled a flying army of ten thousand
men, consisting of his principal nobility and their followers, who were
directed to bring their hawks and dogs with them, that the monarch might
refresh himself with sport during the intervals of military execution.
With this array he swept through Ettrick forest, where he hanged over
the gate of his own castle Piers Cockburn of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> Henderland, who had
prepared, according to tradition, a feast for his reception."</p>


<h3><a name="GENERAL_CRITICISM_AND_ANALYSIS" id="GENERAL_CRITICISM_AND_ANALYSIS"></a>2. GENERAL CRITICISM AND ANALYSIS</h3>

<p><span class="italic">The Lady of the Lake</span> appeared in 1810. Two years before, <span class="italic">Marmion</span> had
vastly increased the popular enthusiasm aroused by <span class="italic">The Lay of the Last
Minstrel</span>, and the success of his second long poem had so exhilarated
Scott that, as he says, he "felt equal to anything and everything." To
one of his kinswomen, who urged him not to jeopardize his fame by
another effort in the same kind, he gaily quoted the words of Montrose:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He either fears his fate too much<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Or his deserts are small,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who dares not put it to the touch,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To win or lose it all.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The result justified his confidence; for not only was <span class="italic">The Lady of the
Lake</span> as successful as its predecessors, but it remains the most
sterling of Scott's poems. The somewhat cheap supernaturalism of the
<span class="italic">Lay</span> appears in it only for a moment; both the story and the characters
are of a less theatrical type than in <span class="italic">Marmion</span>; and it has a glow,
animation, and onset, which was denied to the later poems, <span class="italic">Rokeby</span> and
<span class="italic">The Lord of the Isles</span>.</p>

<p>The following outline abridged from the excellent one given by Francis
Jeffrey in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span><span class="italic"> Review</span> for August, 1810, will be useful as a
basis for criticism of the matter and style of the poem.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The first canto begins with a description of a staghunt in the
Highlands of Perthshire. As the chase lengthens, the sportsmen drop
off; till at last the foremost horseman is left alone; and his
horse, overcome with fatigue, stumbles and dies. The adventurer,
climbing up a craggy eminence, discovers Loch Katrine spread out in
evening glory before him. The huntsman winds his horn; and sees, to
his infinite surprise, a little skiff, guided by a lovely woman,
glide from beneath the trees that overhang the water, and approach
the shore at his feet. Upon the stranger's approach, she pushes the
shallop from the shore in alarm. After a short parley, however, she
carries him to a woody island, where she leads him into a sort of
silvan mansion, rudely constructed, and hung round with trophies of
war and the chase. An elderly lady is introduced at supper; and the
stranger, after disclosing himself to be 'James Fitz-James, the
knight of Snowdoun,' tries in vain to discover the name and history
of the ladies.</p>

<p>"The second canto opens with a picture of the aged harper,
Allan-bane, sitting on the island beach with the damsel, watching
the skiff which carries the stranger back to land. A conversation
ensues, from which the reader gathers that the lady is a daughter
of the Douglas, who, being exiled by royal displeasure from court,
had accepted this asylum from Sir Roderick Dhu, a Highland
chieftain long outlawed for deeds of blood; that this dark chief is
in love with his fair <span class="italic">protégée</span>, but that her affections are
engaged to Malcolm Graeme, a younger and more amiable mountaineer.
The sound of distant music is heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> on the lake; and the barges of
Sir Roderick are discovered, proceeding in triumph to the island.
Ellen, hearing her father's horn at that instant on the opposite
shore, flies to meet him and Malcolm Graeme, who is received with
cold and stately civility by the lord of the isle. Sir Roderick
informs the Douglas that his retreat has been discovered, and that
the King (James V), under pretence of hunting, has assembled a
large force in the neighborhood. He then proposes impetuously that
they should unite their fortunes by his marriage with Ellen, and
rouse the whole Western Highlands. The Douglas, intimating that his
daughter has repugnances which she cannot overcome, declares that
he will retire to a cave in the neighboring mountains until the
issue of the King's threat is seen. The heart of Roderick is wrung
with agony at this rejection; and when Malcolm advances to Ellen,
he pushes him violently back&mdash;and a scuffle ensues, which is with
difficulty appeased by the giant arm of Douglas. Malcolm then
withdraws in proud resentment, plunges into the water, and swims
over by moonlight to the mainland.</p>

<p>"The third canto opens with an account of the ceremonies employed
in summoning the clan. This is accomplished by the consecration of
a small wooden cross, which, with its points scorched and dipped in
blood, is carried with incredible celerity through the whole
territory of the chieftain. The eager fidelity with which this
fatal signal is carried on, is represented with great spirit. A
youth starts from the side of his father's coffin, to bear it
forward, and, having run his stage, delivers it to a young
bridegroom returning from church, who instantly binds his plaid
around him, and rushes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> onward. In the meantime Douglas and his
daughter have taken refuge in the mountain cave; and Sir Roderick,
passing near their retreat on his way to the muster, hears Ellen's
voice singing her evening hymn to the Virgin. He does not obtrude
on her devotions, but hurries to the place of rendezvous.</p>

<p>"The fourth canto begins with some ceremonies by a wild hermit of
the clan, to ascertain the issue of the impending war; and this
oracle is obtained&mdash;that the party shall prevail which first sheds
the blood of its adversary. The scene then shifts to the retreat of
the Douglas, where the minstrel is trying to soothe Ellen in her
alarm at the disappearance of her father by singing a fairy ballad
to her. As the song ends, the knight of Snowdoun suddenly appears
before her, declares his love, and urges her to put herself under
his protection. Ellen throws herself on his generosity, confesses
her attachment to Graeme, and prevails on him to seek his own
safety by a speedy retreat from the territory of Roderick Dhu.
Before he goes, the stranger presents her with a ring, which he
says he has received from King James, with a promise to grant any
boon asked by the person producing it. As he retreats, his
suspicions are excited by the conduct of his guide, and confirmed
by the warnings of a mad woman whom they encounter. His false guide
discharges an arrow at him, which kills the maniac. The knight
slays the murderer; and learning from the expiring victim that her
brain had been turned by the cruelty of Sir Roderick Dhu, he vows
vengeance. When chilled with the midnight cold and exhausted with
fatigue, he suddenly comes upon a chief reposing by a lonely
watch-fire; and being challenged in the name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> Roderick Dhu,
boldly avows himself his enemy. The clansman, however, disdains to
take advantage of a worn-out wanderer; and pledges him safe escort
out of Sir Roderick's territory, when he must answer his defiance
with his sword. The stranger accepts these chivalrous terms; and
the warriors sup and sleep together. This ends the fourth canto.</p>

<p>"At dawn, the knight and the mountaineer proceed toward the Lowland
frontier. A dispute arises concerning the character of Roderick
Dhu, and the knight expresses his desire to meet in person and do
vengeance upon the predatory chief. 'Have then thy wish!' answers
his guide; and gives a loud whistle. A whole legion of armed men
start up from their mountain ambush in the heath; while the chief
turns proudly and says, 'I am Roderick Dhu!' Sir Roderick then by a
signal dismisses his men to their concealment. Arrived at his
frontier, the chief forces the knight to stand upon his defense.
Roderick, after a hard combat is laid wounded on the ground;
Fitz-James, sounding his bugle, brings four squires to his side;
and, after giving the wounded chief into their charge, gallops
rapidly on towards Stirling. As he ascends the hill to the castle,
he descries approaching the same place the giant form of Douglas,
who has come to deliver himself up to the King, in order to save
Malcolm Graeme and Sir Roderick from the impending danger. Before
entering the castle, Douglas is seized with the whim to engage in
the holiday sports which are going forward outside; he wins prize
after prize, and receives his reward from the hand of the prince,
who, however does not condescend to recognize his former favorite.
Roused at last by an insult from one of the royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> grooms, Douglas
proclaims himself, and is ordered into custody by the King. At this
instant a messenger arrives with tidings of an approaching battle
between the clan of Roderick and the King's lieutenant, the Earl of
Mar; and is ordered back to prevent the conflict, by announcing
that both Sir Roderick and Lord Douglas are in the hands of their
sovereign.</p>

<p>"The last canto opens in the guard room of the royal castle at
Stirling, at dawn. While the mercenaries are quarreling and singing
at the close of a night of debauch, the sentinels introduce Ellen
and the minstrel Allan-bane&mdash;who are come in search of Douglas.
Ellen awes the ruffian soldiery by her grace and liberality, and is
at length conducted to a more seemly waiting place, until she may
obtain audience with the King. While Allan-bane, in the cell of Sir
Roderick, sings to the dying chieftain of the glorious battle which
has just been waged by his clansmen against the forces of the Earl
of Mar, Ellen, in another part of the palace, hears the voice of
Malcolm Graeme lamenting his captivity from an adjoining turret.
Before she recovers from her agitation she is startled by the
appearance of Fitz-James, who comes to inform her that the court is
assembled, and the King at leisure to receive her suit. He conducts
her to the hall of presence, round which Ellen casts a timid and
eager glance for the monarch. But all the glittering figures are
uncovered, and James Fitz-James alone wears his cap and plume. The
Knight of Snowdoun is the King of Scotland! Struck with awe and
terror, Ellen falls speechless at his feet, pointing to the ring
which he has put upon her finger. The prince raises her with eager
kindness, declares that her father is forgiven, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> bids her ask
for a boon for some other person. The name of Graeme trembles on
her lips, but she cannot trust herself to utter it. The King, in
playful vengeance, condemns Malcolm Graeme to fetters, takes a
chain of gold from his own neck, and throwing it over that of the
young chief, puts the clasp in the hand of Ellen."</p></blockquote>

<p>From this outline, it will be evident that Scott had gained greatly in
narrative power since the production of <span class="italic">The Lay of the Last Minstrel</span>.
Not only are the elements of the "fable" (to use the word in its
old-fashioned sense) harmonious and probable, but the various incidents
grow out of each other in a natural and necessary way. The <span class="italic">Lay</span> was at
best a skillful bit of carpentering whereof the several parts were
nicely juxtaposed; <span class="italic">The Lady of the Lake</span> is an organism, and its
several members partake of a common life. A few weaknesses may, it is
true, be pointed out in it. The warning of Fitz-James by the mad woman's
song makes too large a draft upon our romantic credulity. Her appearance
is at once so accidental and so opportune that it resembles those
supernatural interventions employed by ancient tragedy to cut the knot
of a difficult situation, which have given rise to the phrase <span class="italic">deus ex
machina</span>. The improbability of the episode is further increased by the
fact that she puts her warning in the form of a song. Scott's love of
romantic episode manifestly led him astray here. Further, the story as a
whole shares with all stories which turn upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> revelation of a
concealed identity, the disadvantage of being able to affect the reader
powerfully but once, since on a second reading the element of suspense
and surprise is lacking. In so far as <span class="italic">The Lady of the Lake</span> is a mere
story, or as it has been called, a "versified novelette," this is not a
weakness; but in so far as it is a poem, with the claim which poetry
legitimately makes to be read and reread for its intrinsic beauty, it
constitutes a real defect.</p>

<p>Not only does this poem, with the slight exceptions just mentioned, show
a gain over the earlier poems in narrative power, but it also marks an
advance in character delineation. The characters of the <span class="italic">Lay</span> are, with
one or two exceptions, mere lay-figures; Lord Cranstoun and Margaret are
the most conventional of lovers; William of Deloraine is little more
than an animated suit of armor, and the Lady of Branksome, except at one
point, when from her walls she defies the English invaders, is nearly or
quite featureless. With the characters of <span class="italic">The Lady of the Lake</span> the
case is very different. The three rivals for Ellen's hand are real men,
with individualities which enhance and deepen the picturesqueness of
each other by contrast. The easy grace and courtly chivalry, of the
disguised King, the quick kindling of his fancy at sight of the
mysterious maid of Loch Katrine, his quick generosity in relinquishing
his suit when he finds that she loves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> another, make him one of the most
life-like figures of romance. Roderick Dhu, nursing darkly his clannish
hatreds, his hopeless love, and his bitter jealousy, with a delicate
chivalry sending its bright thread through the tissue of his savage
nature, is drawn with an equally convincing hand. Against his gloomy
figure the boyish magnanimity of Malcolm Graeme, Ellen's brave
faithfulness, made human by a surface play of coquetry, and the quiet
nobility of the exiled Douglas, stand out in varied relief. Judged in
connection with the more conventional character types of <span class="italic">Marmion</span>, and
with the draped automatons of the <span class="italic">Lay</span>, the characters of <span class="italic">The Lady of
the Lake</span> show the gradual growth in Scott of that dramatic imagination
which was later to fill the vast scene of his prose romances with
unforgettable figures.</p>

<p>But the most significant advance which this poem shows over earlier work
is in the greater genuineness of the poetic effect. In the description,
for example, of the approach of Roderick Dhu's boats to the island,
there is a singular depth of race feeling. There is borne in upon us, as
we read, the realization of a wild and peculiar civilization; we get a
breath of poetry keen and strange, like the shrilling of the bag-pipes
across the water. Again, in the speeding of the fiery cross there is a
primitive depth of poetry which carries with it a sense of "old,
unhappy, far-off things"; it appeals to latent memories in us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> which
have been handed down from an ancestral past. There is nothing in either
<span class="italic">The Lay of the Last Minstrel</span> or <span class="italic">Marmion</span> to compare for natural
dramatic force with the situation in <span class="italic">The Lady of the Lake</span> when
Roderick Dhu whistles for his clansmen to appear, and the astonished
Fitz-James sees the lonely mountain side suddenly bristle with tartans
and spears; and the fight which follows at the ford is a real fight, in
a sense not at all to be applied to the tournaments and other
conventional encounters of the earlier poems. Even where Scott still
clung to supernatural devices to help along his story, he handles them
with much greater subtlety than he had done in his earlier efforts. The
dropping of Douglas's sword from its scabbard when his disguised enemy
enters the room, arouses the imagination without burdening it. It has
the same imaginative advantage over such an episode as that in the
<span class="italic">Lay</span>, where the ghost of the wizard comes to bear off the goblin page,
as suggestion always has over explicit statement. This gain in subtlety
of treatment will be made still more apparent by comparing with any
supernatural episode of the <span class="italic">Lay</span>, the account in <span class="italic">The Lady of the Lake</span>
of the unearthly parentage of Brian the Hermit.</p>

<p>The gain in style is less perceptible. Scott was never a great stylist;
he struck out at the very first a nervous, hurrying meter, and a strong
though rather commonplace diction, upon which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> he never substantially
improved. Abundant action, rapid transitions, stirring descriptions,
common sentiments and ordinary language heightened by a dash of pomp and
novelty, above all a pervading animation, spirit, intrepidity&mdash;these are
the constant elements of Scott's success, present here in their
accustomed measure. In the broader sense of style, however, where the
word is understood to include all the processes leading to a given
poetical effect, <span class="italic">The Lady of the Lake</span> has some advantage, even over
<span class="italic">Marmion</span>. It contains nothing, to be sure, so fine or so typical of
Scott's peculiar power, as the account of the Battle of Flodden in
<span class="italic">Marmion</span>; the minstrel's recital of the battle of Beal' an Duine does
not abide the comparison. The quieter parts of <span class="italic">The Lady of the Lake</span>,
moreover, are sometimes disfigured by a sentimentality and "prettiness"
happily unfrequent with Scott. But the description of the approach of
Roderick Dhu's war-boats, already mentioned, the superb landscape
delineation in the fifth canto, and the beautiful twilight ending of
canto third, can well stand as prime types of Scott's stylistic power.</p>

<a name="NOTES" id="NOTES"></a>NOTES</h2>


<h3>CANTO FIRST</h3>

<p><a href="#line1_2" name="note1_2">2</a>. <span class="bold">witch-elm that shades Saint Fillan's spring.</span> The well or spring of
St. Fillan is on the summit of a hill near Loch Earn, some miles
northeast of the scene of the poem. The reason why Scott places the
"Harp of the North" here is that St. Fillan was the favorite saint of
Robert Bruce, and a relic of the saint had been borne in a shrine by a
warlike abbot at the battle of Bannockburn. The word "witch" (more
properly spelled "wych") is connected with "wicker" and means "bending,"
"drooping."</p>

<p><a href="#line1_10" name="note1_10">10</a>. <span class="bold">Caledon.</span> Caledonia, poetic name for Scotland.</p>

<p><a href="#line1_29" name="note1_29">29</a>. <span class="bold">Monan's rill.</span> Scott takes the liberty of assigning a "rill" to
this Scottish martyr of the fourth century on his own authority, unless
his editors have been at fault in failing to discover the stream
indicated.</p>

<p><a href="#line1_31" name="note1_31">31</a>. <span class="bold">Glenartney's.</span> Glen Artney or Valley of the Artney. The Artney is a
small river northeast of the main scene of the poem.</p>

<p><a href="#line1_33" name="note1_33">33</a>. <span class="bold">Benvoirlich.</span> "Ben" is Scottish for mountain. Benvoirlich is near
the western end of Glenartney.</p>

<p><a href="#line1_53" name="note1_53">53</a>. <span class="bold">Uam-Var.</span> A mountain between Glenartney and the Braes of Doune. The
name signifies "great den," and is derived from a rocky enclosure on the
mountain-side, believed to have been used in primitive times as a toil
or trap for deer. As told in <a href="#line1_74">Stanza IV</a> a giant was fabled to have
inhabited this den.</p>

<p><a href="#line1_71" name="note1_71">71</a>. <span class="bold">linn.</span> This word means either "waterfall" or "steep ravine." The
latter is probably the meaning here.</p>

<p><a href="#line1_89" name="note1_89">89</a>. <span class="bold">Menteith.</span> A village and district southeast of the line of
lakes&mdash;Loch Katrine, Loch Achray, and Loch Vennachar&mdash;about which the
main action of the poem moves.</p>

<p><a href="#line1_93" name="note1_93">93</a>. <span class="bold">Lochard.</span> Loch Ard, a small lake south of Loch Katrine.
<span class="bold">Aberfoyle.</span> A village east of Loch Ard.</p>

<p><a href="#line1_95" name="note1_95">95</a>. <span class="bold">Loch-Achray.</span> See note on <a href="#note1_89">89</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span><a href="#line1_97" name="note1_97">97</a>. <span class="bold">Benvenue.</span> A mountain on the south bank of Loch Katrine.</p>

<p><a href="#line1_103" name="note1_103">103</a>. <span class="bold">Cambusmore.</span> An estate owned by Scott's friends, the Buchanans, on
the border of the Braes of Doune.</p>

<p><a href="#line1_105" name="note1_105">105</a>. <span class="bold">Benledi.</span> A majestic mountain shutting in the horizon to the north
of Loch Vennachar.</p>

<p><a href="#line1_106" name="note1_106">106</a>. <span class="bold">Bochastle's heath.</span> The plain between Loch Vennachar and the river
Teith.</p>

<p><a href="#line1_112" name="note1_112">112</a>. <span class="bold">Brigg of Turk.</span> A romantic bridge, still in existence, between
Loch Vennachar and Loch Achray.</p>

<p><a href="#line1_120" name="note1_120">120</a>. <span class="bold">dogs of black Saint Hubert's breed.</span> A breed of dogs, usually
black in color, very keen of scent and powerful in build, were kept by
the abbots of St. Hubert in commemoration of their patron saint, who was
a hunter.</p>

<p><a href="#line1_138" name="note1_138">138</a>. <span class="bold">whinyard.</span> Obsolete term for <span class="italic">sword</span>.</p>

<p><a href="#line1_145" name="note1_145">145</a>. <span class="bold">Trossachs.</span> A wild and beautiful defile between Loch Katrine and
Loch Achray. The word signifies "rough or bristled country."</p>

<p><a href="#line1_166" name="note1_166">166</a>. <span class="bold">Woe worth the chase.</span> "Woe worth" is an exclamation, equivalent to
"alack!"</p>

<p><a href="#line1_178" name="note1_178">178</a>. <span class="bold">Round and around the sounds were cast.</span> Notice the mimicry of the
echo in the vowel sounds of the line.</p>

<p><a href="#line1_196" name="note1_196">196</a>. <span class="bold">tower ... on Shinar's plain.</span> The Tower of Babel.</p>

<p><a href="#line1_208" name="note1_208">208</a>. <span class="bold">dewdrops sheen.</span> What part of speech is <span class="italic">sheen</span>? Is this use of
the word obsolete in prose?</p>

<p><a href="#line1_227" name="note1_227">227</a>. <span class="bold">frequent flung.</span> "Frequent" is used in the original Latin sense
(Lat. <span class="italic">frequens</span>) of "crowded together," "numerous."</p>

<p><a href="#line1_256" name="note1_256">256</a>. <span class="bold">Unless he climb, with footing nice.</span> Scott says: "Until the
present road was made through the romantic pass I have presumptuously
attempted to describe, there was no mode of issuing out of the defile
called the Trossachs, excepting by a sort of ladder, composed of the
branches and roots of trees." What is the meaning of "nice" here? What
other meanings has the word had?</p>

<p><a href="#line1_313" name="note1_313">313</a>. <span class="bold">Highland plunderers.</span> The clans inhabiting the region about Loch
Katrine were in the habit of making incursions into the neighboring
Lowlands to plunder and lay waste the country. Their warlike habits were
fostered by the rugged and almost inaccessible character of the country,
which prevented the Lowlanders from retaliating upon them, and enabled
them also to resist the royal authority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
<a href="#line1_363" name="note1_363">363</a>. <span class="bold">snood.</span> A ribbon worn by Scotch lassies and upon marriage replaced
by the matron's "curch" or cap. <span class="bold">plaid.</span> A rectangular shawl-like
garment made of the checkered cloth called tartan.</p>

<p><a href="#line1_438" name="note1_438">438</a>. <span class="bold">couch was pulled.</span> Freshly pulled heather was the most luxurious
bedding known to the Highlander.</p>

<p><a href="#line1_440" name="note1_440">440</a>. <span class="bold">ptarmigan and heath-cock.</span> These birds are a species of grouse,
the one red, the other black.</p>

<p><a href="#line1_460" name="note1_460">460</a>. <span class="bold">on the visioned future bent.</span> The gift of second-sight was
universally believed in at this period in the Highlands.</p>

<p><a href="#line1_504" name="note1_504">504</a>. <span class="bold">retreat in dangerous hour.</span> "The Celtic chieftains, whose lives
were continually exposed to peril, had usually, in the most retired spot
of their domain, some place of retreat for the hour of necessity ... a
tower, a cavern, or a rustic hut." (Scott's note in edition of 1830.)</p>

<p><a href="#line1_546" name="note1_546">546</a>. <span class="bold">target.</span> What is the connection of this word with that used in
archery and gun-practice?</p>

<p><a href="#line1_566" name="note1_566">566</a>. <span class="bold">brook to wield.</span> "Brook" commonly means "endure." What is its
exact meaning here?</p>

<p><a href="#line1_573" name="note1_573">573</a>. <span class="bold">Ferragus, or Ascabart.</span> Two giants whose names appear frequently
in medieval romances of chivalry. The first is better known as Ferran,
under which name he figures in the <span class="italic">Orlando Furioso</span> of Ariosto.
Ascabart plays a part in the old English metrical romance of Sir Bevis
of Hampton.</p>

<p><a href="#line1_580" name="note1_580">580</a>. <span class="bold">To whom, though more than kindred knew.</span> This is a very obscure
expression for Scott, who is usually so careful to make himself clear.
The meaning seems to be: Ellen regarded her as a mother, though that was
more than the actual kinship of the two justified (literally "knew how
to recognize").</p>

<p><a href="#line1_591" name="note1_591">591</a>. <span class="bold">Knight of Snowdoun, James Fitz-James.</span> As appears later in the
poem, these were not his true name and title, though he was entitled to
bear them.</p>

<p><a href="#line1_622" name="note1_622">622</a>. <span class="bold">a harp unseen.</span> In modern Scotland the bagpipe has altogether
taken the place of the harp. A writer of the sixteenth century says:
"They (the Highlanders) take great delight to deck their harps with
silver and precious stones; the poor ones that cannot attain thereunto
deck them with crystal. They sing verses prettily compounded (i.e.,
composed) containing for the most part praises of valiant men."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span><a href="#line1_638" name="note1_638">638</a>. <span class="bold">pibroch.</span> (Pronounced pee-brock.) A wild tumultuous tune played on
the bagpipes in the onset of battle.</p>

<p><a href="#line1_642" name="note1_642">642</a>. <span class="bold">bittern.</span> A wading bird, allied to the heron.</p>

<p><a href="#line1_657" name="note1_657">657</a>. <span class="bold">reveillé.</span> As the rhyme shows, this word is pronounced
<span class="italic">reh-vail'yah</span> here. The common pronunciation in the United States is
<span class="italic">rev-a-lee'</span>. It is the drum-beat or bugle-call at dawn to arouse
soldiers.</p>


<h3>CANTO SECOND</h3>

<p><a href="#line2_1" name="note2_1">1</a>. <span class="bold">blackcock.</span> See note to I, <a href="#note1_440">440</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#line2_7" name="note2_7">7</a>. <span class="bold">minstrel grey.</span> Until well on in the eighteenth century it was
customary for Highland chieftains to keep in their service a bard, whose
chief duty it was to sing the exploits of the ancestors of the line.</p>

<p><a href="#line2_69" name="note2_69">69</a>. <span class="bold">Lead forth his fleet.</span> What kind of figure is contained in the word
<span class="italic">fleet</span> as applied to the flock of ducks?</p>

<p><a href="#line2_131" name="note2_131">131</a>. <span class="bold">harp, which erst Saint Modan swayed.</span> St. Modan was not a harper,
as Scott elsewhere ingenuously confesses, adding, however, that "Saint
Dunstan certainly did play upon that instrument."</p>

<p><a href="#line2_141" name="note2_141">141</a>. <span class="bold">Wailed loud through Bothwell's bannered hall.</span> The minstrel tries
to account for the strange way in which his harp gives back mournful
sounds instead of the joyous ones he is trying to evoke, by calling to
Ellen's mind two other occasions when it behaved similarly. One of these
was when it foreboded the death of Ellen's mother; the other when it
foreboded the exile of the Douglasses during the minority of James V.
For particulars, see the introduction on the historical setting of the
poem. Bothwell Castle is on the Clyde, a few miles from Glasgow.</p>

<p><a href="#line2_159" name="note2_159">159</a>. <span class="bold">From Tweed to Spey.</span> The Tweed is in the extreme southern part,
the Spey in the northern part, of Scotland.</p>

<p><a href="#line2_200" name="note2_200">200</a>. <span class="bold">Lady of the Bleeding Heart.</span> The minstrel calls Ellen so because a
bleeding heart was the heraldic emblem of the Douglas family.</p>

<p><a href="#line2_206" name="note2_206">206</a>. <span class="bold">strathspey.</span> A dance, named from the district of Strath Spey, in
the north of Scotland. It resembled the reel, but was slower.</p>

<p><a href="#line2_213" name="note2_213">213</a>. <span class="bold">Clan-Alpine's pride.</span> Clan Alpine was the collective name of the
followers of Roderick Dhu, who figures later in the poem as Ellen's
rejected suitor and the enemy of the mysterious "Knight of Snowdoun" who
has just taken his departure from the island.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span><a href="#line2_216" name="note2_216">216</a>. <span class="bold">Lennox foray.</span> Lennox is the district south of Menteith, in the
Lowlands. It was the scene of innumerable forays and "cattle-drives."</p>

<p><a href="#line2_221" name="note2_221">221</a>. <span class="bold">In Holy-Rood a knight he slew.</span> Holyrood is the royal castle at
Edinburgh, where the court usually was held. It was deemed a heinous and
desperate offense to commit an act of blood in the royal residence or
its immediate neighborhood, since such an act was an indirect violation
of the majesty of the king, and a breaking of "the king's peace." It was
for this offense that Roderick Dhu was exiled, and compelled to live
like an outlaw in his mountain fastness.</p>

<p><a href="#line2_227" name="note2_227">227</a>. <span class="bold">Who else dared give.</span> Notice how skilfully Scott manages to give
us the relations of the chief characters of the poem to each other, and
to show that Ellen's father, pursued by the hatred of James V, has been
given the island shelter in Loch Katrine by Roderick Dhu who is about to
make his appearance in the story.</p>

<p><a href="#line2_236" name="note2_236">236</a>. <span class="bold">Full soon may dispensation sought.</span> A papal dispensation was
necessary, because Ellen and Roderick Dhu were cousins. See next note.</p>

<p><a href="#line2_249" name="note2_249">249</a>. <span class="bold">All that a mother could bestow.</span> Here again the poet takes the
indirect way of making clear his point, namely that the matron
introduced in the first canto is the mother of Roderick Dhu. The phrase
"an orphan in the wild," is in apposition with the following phrase "her
sister's child"&mdash;i.e., Ellen herself. From this it appears that Lady
Margaret is Ellen's aunt, and that Roderick Dhu is, therefore, Ellen's
cousin.</p>

<p><a href="#line2_260" name="note2_260">260</a>. <span class="bold">Maronnan's cell.</span> A chapel at the eastern extremity of Loch
Lomond, dedicated to the rather obscure saint here named.</p>

<p><a href="#line2_270" name="note2_270">270</a>. <span class="bold">Bracklinn's thundering wave.</span> The reference is to a cascade made
by a mountain torrent at the Bridge of Bracklinn, near the village of
Callender in Menteith. Notice how Scott's numerous references to places
in the region where the poem is laid tend gradually to give us an idea
of the richness and diversity of the landscape.</p>

<p><a href="#line2_274" name="note2_274">274</a>. <span class="bold">claymore.</span> A large two-handed sword.</p>

<p><a href="#line2_305" name="note2_305">305</a>. <span class="bold">Thy father's battle-brand.</span> Some swords, especially those which
had been magically forged, were held to possess the property of drawing
themselves from their scabbard at the approach of their owner's deadly
enemy. This is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span> first vague hint which Scott gives us as to the real
identity of the "Knight of Snowdoun." To throw a further glamor of
romance about the prophetical weapon, he tells us that it was given by
fairies to an ancestor of its present owner, namely, to Archibald, third
Duke of Angus, called Tine-man (Loseman) because he always lost his men
in battle, and that this gift was made while Archibald was in league
with Harry Hotspur.</p>

the first meaning "descendant of," the second "black or swarthy." King
Alpine was the half-mythical ancestor from whom the clan of Alpine
sprung. The line means, therefore, "Black Roderick, descendant of
Alpine." Compare II, xii, <a href="#line2_220">220</a>, where Allan-bane calls the chieftain
"Black Sir Roderick."</p>

<p><a href="#line3_154" name="note3_154">154</a>. <span class="bold">River Demon.</span> Concerning this creature Scott gives the current
observation: "The River Demon, or River-horse, is an evil spirit,
delighting to forebode and witness calamity. He frequents most Highland
lakes and rivers; and one of his most memorable exploits was performed
upon the banks of Loch Vennachar: it consisted in the destruction of a
bridal party with all its attendants."</p>

<p><a href="#line3_156" name="note3_156">156</a>. <span class="bold">noontide hag.</span> A gigantic emaciated female figure which, contrary

<p><a href="#line3_168" name="note3_168">168</a>. <span class="bold">Ben-Shie's boding scream.</span> The ben-shie or banshee was a tutelar
spirit, supposed to forebode by midnight howlings the death of a member

Alpine were the chief. The name means "Isle of Nuns," or "Isle of Old

<p><a href="#line3_199" name="note3_199">Stanza IX</a>. Notice the change in the rime system which marks the break
from flowing narrative to solemn dramatic speech, and is continued
through the stanza to increase the effect of solemnity.</p>

<p><a href="#line3_253" name="note3_253">253</a>. <span class="bold">Coir-Uriskin, thy goblin cave.</span> This cave and the pass of
Beala-nam-bo were on the slopes of Ben Venue, a mountain near Loch

<p><a href="#line3_461" name="note3_461">461</a>. <span class="bold">chapel of St. Bride.</span> This chapel stood on the knoll of
Strath-Ire, mentioned at the beginning of the stanza, halfway up the
pass of Leny. Scott is singularly careful not to take liberties with the
geography of the localities where his story is laid.</p>

herbage may spring up.</p>

<p><a href="#line3_578" name="note3_578">578</a>. <span class="bold">Loch Voil</span>, etc. This and the following names are of poetic value
in suggesting tangibly the rapid passage of the runner from place to
place.</p>

<p><a href="#line3_622" name="note3_622">622</a>. <span class="bold">Coir-nan-Uriskin.</span> Scott says that this name, signifying "Den of
the Shaggy Men," was derived from the mythical inhabitants of the place,

<h3><a name="HELPS_TO_STUDY" id="HELPS_TO_STUDY"></a>HELPS TO STUDY</h3>


<h4><span class="smcap">Life of Scott</span></h4>

<p>What prominent traits of Scott's character can be traced to his
ancestors (pp. <a href="#Page_9">9</a>, <a href="#Page_10">10</a>)?</p>

<p>How did he regard the members of his clan, especially the chief (pp. <a href="#Page_19">19</a>,
<a href="#Page_20">20</a>)?</p>

<p>What characteristic is represented in his refusal to learn Latin and
Greek at school?</p>

<p>What was his own method of obtaining an education? In what did he become
proficient (p. <a href="#Page_12">12</a>)?</p>

<p>How did he regard his legal studies? How did they benefit him in his
later work?</p>

<p>How was he first interested in ballad-writing?</p>

<p>Tell of the composition, publication, and popularity of his first poems
(pp. <a href="#Page_20">20</a> ff.).</p>

<p>In what business venture did he become involved, and what was the final
outcome? What defect in his character is it charged that his business
relations brought to light (pp. <a href="#Page_24">24</a>, <a href="#Page_25">25</a>)?</p>

<p>Tell of the composition of his novels. Why were they published
incognito?</p>

<p>What can you say of his last years and his struggle to pay off the debts
incurred by his connection with Ballantyne?</p>


<h4><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Scott and the Romantic Movement</span></h4>

<p>What is meant by the "Romantic Movement"? What four men were chiefly
instrumental in bringing about this revolution in English poetry (p.
<a href="#Page_40">40</a>)?</p>

<p>What was the influence of Scott's poetry on the age in comparison with
that of his chief contemporaries? Give the reasons (p. <a href="#Page_41">41</a>).</p>

<p>What were the distinguishing qualities of the literature of the
eighteenth century? Illustrate these by examples from Pope or any other
poet that you choose from that period, and put them into contrast with
the qualities of the romantic poets. Does Scott's style differ greatly
from that of the poets of the preceding century?</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Lady of the Lake&mdash;Construction</span></h4>

<p>Is there anything that has taken place before the opening of the poem
that has to be understood for a thorough appreciation of the story (p.
<a href="#Page_46">46</a>)? How are the previous fortunes of the Douglas family related (pp.
<a href="#Page_96">96</a>&ndash;98)?</p>

<p>What purpose in the plot does the Minstrel serve throughout?</p>

<p>What do you think of the opening?</p>

<p>Does the chase serve merely to furnish an opportunity for the
description?</p>

<p>Is the action rapid or slow? How is it often retarded?</p>

<p>For what are the songs introduced?</p>

<p>Note the transition from stanza X to XI (p. <a href="#Page_66">66</a>); from XVI to XVII (p.
<a href="#Page_71">71</a>); from XXIV to XXV (p. <a href="#Page_144">144</a>); and many others.</p>

<p>How many cases of concealed identity are there in the poem? Does this
turning of the plot on mistaken identity make it seem unreal? Show in
each case where the identity is exposed and where hints have been given
beforehand of the real identity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>Is there any intimation of the identity of Ellen and her father in lines
<a href="#line1_565">565</a>&ndash;7, page <a href="#Page_81">81</a>; lines <a href="#line1_728">728</a>&ndash;39, page <a href="#Page_87">87</a>?</p>

<p>What is the purpose of Fitz-James's dream (p. <a href="#Page_86">86</a>)?</p>

<p>What is the first hint of Ellen's love story and the name of her lover
(pp. <a href="#Page_74">74</a>, <a href="#Page_92">92</a>)?</p>

<p>When is Roderick Dhu first mentioned (p. <a href="#Page_96">96</a>)? In what light?</p>

<p>Where are the relations of Ellen with Roderick and with Malcolm further
discussed (p. <a href="#Page_98">98</a>)?</p>

<p>To whom is the reference in lines <a href="#line2_732">732</a>&ndash;34, page <a href="#Page_116">116</a>?</p>

<p>What action does the struggle between Roderick and Malcolm motive?</p>

<p>How does Canto Third advance the plot? What is its poetical value (p.
<a href="#Page_56">56</a>)?</p>

<p>What purpose does Brian serve?</p>

<p>Does the prophecy (p. <a href="#Page_157">157</a>) heighten the dramatic effect of the following
scene (see p. <a href="#Page_196">196</a>)?</p>

<p>For what are lines <a href="#line4_138">138</a>&ndash;47, page <a href="#Page_157">157</a>, a preparation (p. <a href="#Page_168">168</a>)?</p>

<p>What is the purpose of the Ballad of Alice Brand (pp. <a href="#Page_162">162</a> ff.)?</p>

<p>What other results of Scott's early interest in ballad literature can
you point out in <span class="italic">The Lady of the Lake</span>?</p>

<p>Does the warning of James by the song of mad Blanche seem improbable?</p>

<p>What is the purpose of the long speeches between James and Roderick in
the dramatic scene following Roderick's calling of his men?</p>

<p>Does the combat between James and Roderick (pp. <a href="#Page_198">198</a>, <a href="#Page_199">199</a>) seem a real
fight?</p>

<p>Why was Roderick preserved to die in the castle at Stirling?</p>

<p>Are lines <a href="#line5_519">519</a>&ndash;30, page <a href="#Page_203">203</a>, an artistic preparation for the following
scene?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>How do the games in the Castle park hasten the plot to its end?</p>

<p>How is the fight between Clan-Alpine and the Earl of Mar described?</p>

<p>How much of the action takes place outside the poem and is related?</p>

<p>Note the use of the supernatural (p. <a href="#Page_239">239</a>). Does it seem impressive?</p>

<p>Is the conclusion sustained and dramatic?</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Description</span></h4>

<p>Are the nature descriptions given for scenic effect, or do they serve as
a background and setting for the story?</p>

<p>Does Scott employ incidents of plot for the sake of dragging in
descriptions?</p>

<p>Which is the best in the poem: nature description, plot construction,
character, description, or the portrayal of old life and customs?</p>

<p>Is the descriptive language suggestive?</p>

<p>Are the landscape scenes given minutely, or are they drawn broadly, with
a free hand?</p>

<p>Does Scott keep closely to the geography of the region of his tale (see
map, p. <a href="#MAP">6</a>, and note <a href="#note3_461">461</a>, p. <a href="#Page_259">259</a>)?</p>

<p>Perry Pictures 912&ndash;17 (from Landseer's paintings of deer) and 1511 (Ben
Lomond) may be used in illustration of <span class="italic">The Lady of the Lake</span>.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Characters</span></h4>

<p>Are the characters distinctly drawn&mdash;do they seem real people of flesh
and blood?</p>

<p>How is Ellen's character displayed?</p>

<p>Do you feel any sympathy for Roderick Dhu? Does your impression of his
character improve (pp. <a href="#Page_96">96</a>, <a href="#Page_98">98</a>, <a href="#Page_99">99</a>, <a href="#Page_182">182</a>, <a href="#Page_188">188</a>, <a href="#Page_195">195</a>, and <a href="#Page_241">241</a>)?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>Was Douglas an historical character?</p>

<p>Is the character of James Fitz-James true to James V of Scotland?</p>

<p>Is Allan-bane representative of the place in the ancient Scottish clan
which the minstrel had?</p>

<a name="CLASSES_OF_POETRY" id="CLASSES_OF_POETRY"></a>
CLASSES OF POETRY</h3>

<p>It is important for the student of poetry to know the principal classes
into which poems are divided. The following brief explanations do not
pretend to be exhaustive, but they should be of practical aid. It must
be remembered that a long poem is sometimes not very definitely of any
one class, but combines characteristics of different classes.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Narrative</span> poetry, like narrative prose, aims primarily to tell a
story.</p>

<p>The <span class="italic">epic</span> is the most pretentious kind of narrative poetry; it tells in
serious verse of the great deeds of a popular hero. The <span class="italic">Iliad</span>, the
<span class="italic">Aeneid</span>, <span class="italic">Beowulf</span>, <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span> are important epics. The <span class="italic">Idylls of
the King</span> is in the main an epic poem.</p>

<p>The <span class="italic">metrical romance</span> is a rather long story in verse, of a less
exalted and heroic character than the true epic. Scott's <span class="italic">Lady of the
Lake</span> is a familiar example.</p>

<p>The <span class="italic">verse tale</span> is shorter and likely to be less dignified and serious
than the metrical romance. The stories in Chaucer's <span class="italic">Canterbury Tales</span>,
or Burns's <span class="italic">Tam O'Shanter</span>, may serve as examples.</p>

<p>The <span class="italic">ballad</span> is a narrative poem, usually rather short and in such form
as to be sung. It is distinguished from a song by the fact that it tells
a story. <span class="italic">Popular</span> or <span class="italic">folk</span> ballads are ancient and of unknown
authorship&mdash;handed down by word of mouth and varied by the transmitters.
<span class="italic">Artistic</span> ballads are imitations, by known poets, of traditional
ballads.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Descriptive</span> and <span class="italic">reflective</span> poems have characteristics sufficiently
indicated by the adjectives in italics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>The <span class="italic">pastoral</span> is a particular kind of descriptive and narrative poem in
which the scene is laid in the country.</p>

<p>The <span class="italic">idyll</span> is, according to the etymology of its name, a "little
picture." Tennyson's <span class="italic">Idylls of the King</span> are rather more epic than
idyllic in the strict sense of the term. The terms <span class="italic">idyll</span> and
<span class="italic">pastoral</span> are not definitely discriminated.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Lyric</span> poetry is poetry expressing personal feeling or emotion and in
tuneful form. <span class="italic">Songs</span> are the simplest examples of lyric poetry; formal
<span class="italic">odes</span>, such as Wordsworth's on "Immortality," the most elaborate. A
lyric does not primarily tell a story, but it may imply one or refer to
one.</p>

<p>The <span class="italic">elegy</span> is a reflective lyric prompted by the death of some one.
Tennyson's <span class="italic">In Memoriam</span> is a collection of elegiac lyrics.</p>

<p>A <span class="italic">hymn</span> is a religious lyric.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Dramatic</span> poetry presents human life in speech and action.</p>

<p>A <span class="italic">tragedy</span> is a serious drama which presents its hero in a losing
struggle ending in his death.</p>

<p>A <span class="italic">comedy</span> does not end in death, and is usually cheerful and humorous.</p>

<p>The <span class="italic">dramatic monologue</span> is a poem in which a dramatic situation is
presented, or perhaps a story is told, by one speaker.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Satire</span> in verse aims to correct abuses, to ridicule persons, etc.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Didactic</span> poetry has the purpose of teaching.</p>
